### Why Did Elon Musk Go After Bunkers Full of Seeds?

> In a climate-controlled bunker in an unremarkable building in rural Aberdeen, Idaho, there are shelves upon shelves of meticulously labeled boxes of seed. This vault is home to many of the United States’ more than 62,000 genetically unique lines of wheat, collected over the past 127 years from around the world.

>Though dormant, these seeds are alive. But unless they are continually cared for and periodically replanted, the lines will die, along with the millenniums of evolutionary history that they embody.

### Trump’s Executive Order on Antisemitism Is a Threat to Every American

> On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on antisemitism. A White House fact sheet, obtained by reporters ahead of the order, proclaimed that “Immediate action will be taken by the Department of Justice to protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.” Trump also vowed, “To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you. I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.”

> In other words, Trump’s plan to fight antisemitism is to use the powers of the U.S. government to go after universities, and to deport people, including students, who are here on visas if the protests in which they are participating are deemed to be sympathetic to Hamas.

### Trump Orders Schools to Ease Sex Assault Rules

> Donald Trump rammed through new Title IX rules for federally funded K-12 schools and colleges Friday—dramatically changing how they deal with sex assault claims and LGBT students.

> ...

> The new policy, announced on Friday, resuscitates the Title IX policy changes Trump implemented in 2018 during his first term. It reduces the liability placed on schools in sexual misconduct cases. It also requires live hearings and cross-examinations, and allows lawyers to be present at those hearings.
> Trump’s order included language to justify his decision not to utilize the traditional and protracted process to make new rules. The letter stated, “the president’s interpretation of the law governs because he alone controls and supervises subordinate officers” in the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, which enforces the rules.

### ‘There will be many casualties’: Panama girds for war as Rubio opens talks

> Marco Rubio’s weekend visit to Panama is set to offer clues to a pressing question: whether the next four years of American policy will more closely resemble an imperial conquest or a hardball real estate negotiation.

> On the ground here, members of the country’s small political elite have been bracing for either: As tensions over the Panama Canal ratcheted up last month, Panama’s former president, Ernesto Pérez Balladares, sat in his office on the 10th floor of a bank building and contemplated the worst-case scenario: an American invasion. “I think there will be many, many casualties on our side,” he said, “and international condemnation of the U.S.”

> ... As she lays out in her lawsuit, however, board member Wilcox’s removal was unprecedented and unlawful, in contravention of decades of Supreme Court precedent.

> The National Labor Relations Act makes crystal clear that board members, who serve as specialized judges for labor law, can only be removed from office for
>  “neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause,” and only “upon notice and hearing.” The president made no pretense of accusing Wilcox
>  of misconduct—she is a dedicated public servant with a sterling reputation—or providing her any opportunity for a hearing. Instead, the president summarily
>  fired her because he disagreed with her decisions as a board member.

Hegseth told almost 50 of Ukraine ’s Western backers on Wednesday that he had joined their meeting “to directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe.”

“The United States faces consequential threats to our homeland. We must — and we are — focusing on security of our own borders,” he said.

Reading the riot act to U.S. allies, Hegseth said that Ukraine will not get all its territory back from Russia and will not be allowed to join NATO, which would provide the ultimate security guarantee to ensure that Russian President Vladimir Putin never attacks it again.

> The new HHS secretary has made baseless claims that the drugs are addictive and cause violent behavior.

> many of his statements about these drugs are not backed by science. In a 2023 livestream on X with Elon Musk, he claimed that “tremendous
> circumstantial evidence” suggested that people taking antidepressants were more likely to commit school shootings. (Actually, most school
> shooters were not taking those drugs, evidence shows.) Kennedy has also called people who take SSRIs addicts—and then tried to claim he
> didn’t during his confirmation hearings.

> Kennedy said he planned to dedicate money generated from a sales tax on cannabis products to “creating wellness farms—drug rehabilitation
> farms, in rural areas all over this country.” He added, “I’m going to create these wellness farms where they can go to get off of illegal
> drugs, off of opiates, but also illegal drugs, other psychiatric drugs, if they want to, to get off of SSRIs, to get off of benzos, to get
> off of Adderall, and to spend time as much time as they need—three or four years if they need it—to learn to get reparented, to reconnect
> with communities.”

President Donald Trump's administration officially announced its plan for federal staff reductions in a Wednesday memo, telling agencies to prepare to cut staff and reorganize their departments by March 13.

Federal workers who spoke with Business Insider after the memo was announced said the move was "crazy and illogical." Still, some were determined to continue working until they were removed from office.

FDA Cancels Critical Flu Vaccine Meeting With No Explanation

Experts worry that the cancelation could delay vaccine preparations for the 2025-2026 flu season 

The Food and Drug Administration abruptly canceled a critical meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), which gathers annually in March to determine what flu strains will be covered by next year’s vaccine. 

The sudden cancellation of the meeting comes amid anxiety at federal health agencies over the future of vaccine programs under the Trump administration, and the stewardship of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist.

Trump administration retreats in fight against Russian cyber threats

Recent incidents indicate US is no longer characterizing Russia as a cybersecurity threat, marking a radical departure: ‘Putin is on the inside now’

The Trump administration has publicly and privately signaled that it does not believe Russia represents a cyber threat against US national security or critical infrastructure, marking a radical departure from longstanding intelligence assessments.

A recent memo at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) set out new priorities for the agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security and monitors cyber threats against US critical infrastructure. The new directive set out priorities that included China and protecting local systems. It did not mention Russia.

A person familiar with the matter who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity said analysts at the agency were verbally informed that they were not to follow or report on Russian threats, even though this had previously been a main focus for the agency.

Trump administration halts funding for two cybersecurity efforts

The Trump administration has cut millions of dollars in federal funding from two cybersecurity initiatives, including one dedicated to helping state and local election officials

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, has ended about $10 million in annual funding to the nonprofit Center for Internet Security, a CISA spokesperson said in an email Monday.

CISA announced a few weeks ago that it was conducting a review of its election-related work, and more than a dozen staffers who have worked on elections were placed on administrative leave. That followed an administration move to disband an FBI task force focused on investigating foreign influence operations, including those that target U.S. elections.
